# LaTeX

Following [this](https://jdhao.github.io/2019/03/26/nvim_latex_write_preview/) tutorial
- TeXLive is installed from the [Fedora Repo](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/neurofedora/latex/)
- NOTE: do NOT install TeXLive-full, as it will mess with the system font configuration. Installing Medium seems to be okay, and from there it is required to manually install what is missing.
## Nvim

Using the VimTeX Plugin and previewing using Zathura.
Pre-requisites: Latexmk
